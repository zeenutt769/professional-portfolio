        "A high-performance Node.js scraping backend that aggregates product data from multiple Indian e-commerce platforms with concurrency control, normalization, and category-aware routing.",
    longDescription: `
Bazzarly Scraper Engine is a Node.js + Express backend designed to fetch, normalize, and aggregate product listings from multiple Indian e-commerce platforms in real time.

The system routes search queries based on category (tech, fashion, accessories) and executes multiple scraper modules concurrently with controlled parallelism to avoid rate limits and blocking. Each scraper runs in isolation with individual error handling, execution timing, and per-site product limits.

Results from all platforms are normalized into a unified schema and returned with detailed timing metadata, enabling downstream AI ranking, filtering, and recommendation pipelines. Google Shopping is handled as a priority scraper with isolated execution to ensure fast fallback data.

The engine is built to be extensible—new scrapers can be added by simply registering a function and defining a product limit—while maintaining predictable performance and fault tolerance.
